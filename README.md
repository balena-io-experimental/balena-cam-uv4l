# resin-cam-uv4l
A smart Raspberry Pi streaming camera based on [UV4L](https://www.linux-projects.org/uv4l/).

It works on all the Raspberry Pi's with a camera connectorâ€”even the Pi Zero!

### **[Bill of Materials](docs/BoM.md)**

## Getting started

- Sign up on [resin.io](https://dashboard.resin.io/signup)
- Select your Raspberry Pi's version and create a new application
- Follow the instructions on downloading and flashing [resinOS](https://resinos.io) to your Pi
- Clone this repository to your local workspace
- Set these variables in the `Fleet Configuration` application side tab
  - `RESIN_HOST_CONFIG_gpu_mem` = `196`
  - `RESIN_HOST_CONFIG_start_x` = `1`
- Add the _resin remote_ to your local workspace by running the useful command in the Resin dashboard

- Push code to your device with a simple `git push resin master`
  - See the magic happening, your device is getting updated Over-The-Air!
- If you want your device to be accessible on WAN, enable its public URL
  - Select your device from the `Devices` side tab
  - Click the `Actions` side tab
  - Click the `ENABLE PUBLIC DEVICE URL` button
  - Note down your device's public URL!
- When your device finishes updating visit your device's IP or public URL to watch your stream!
  - You can find your device's IP on the Resin dashboard.
- Further explore [UV4L's configuration options](https://www.linux-projects.org/uv4l/tutorials/) and edit [the config file](config/uv4l.conf)
- Make sure to update your devices after every change you make! You can either:
  - Commit your changes and do another `git push resin master`
  - Learn more about the powerful [**resin-cli**](https://github.com/resin-io/resin-cli) and how you can iterate and deploy to your devices rapidly!

## Configure via [environment variables](https://docs.resin.io/management/env-vars/)
Variable Name | Default | Description
------------ | ------------- | -------------
width | `640` | video width
height | `480` | video height
framerate | `30` | video framerate
rotation | `0` | video rotation (0/90/180/270 degrees)

If you want to add more environment variables to control [UV4L's config file](config/uv4l.conf) add a line of this format `set_option <UV4L_OPTION_NAME> $<ENV_VAR_NAME> <PATH_TO_CONFIG>` to the [start script](app/start.sh). It will be easy once you see the existing lines.
